# AI Railway Information System
The AI Railway Information System leverages an intelligent conversational interface, allowing users to query the following:

* **Trains running from a source (Point A) to a destination (Point B)**  
  Example: `What are the trains running from 'LOKMANYATILAK T - LTT' to 'BHOPAL JN - BPL'?`

* **Whether a train runs on a specific day or get its running days**  
  Example: `Does train number '01123' run on Friday? Can you list its running days?`

* **The list of stops for a given train**  
  Example: `What is the arrival schedule of train '01123' at 'THANE - TNA'?`

* **The schedule timings of a train, optionally at a specific stop**  
  Example: `Can you list all the stops of train '01123'?`

The agent always responds courteously and accurately, in **no more than one sentence**, and is designed **not to hallucinate**.

## System Architecture

The AI Railway Information System follows a modular, layered architecture that separates user interaction, AI orchestration, business logic, and data management for clarity and maintainability.

**1. Frontend / User Interface**
- Built using **Gradio**, providing an interactive chat-based interface.
- Allows users to ask natural language questions related to train schedules, routes, and availability.
- Displays concise, single-sentence responses generated by the system.

**2. AI Query Handler**
- Receives user input from the frontend and constructs structured prompts.
- Interacts with the language model to interpret user intent.
- Determines which predefined function (tool) should be invoked based on the query type.
- Supported tools:
  - `find_trains`
  - `train_schedule`
  - `check_running_days`
  - `train_routes`

**3. Tool Call Handler**
- Acts as a bridge between the AI model and the application logic.
- Parses tool call arguments generated by the model.
- Routes requests to the appropriate method in `TrainQueryService`.
- Serializes responses into JSON or plain text for frontend consumption.

**4. Train Query Service**
- Implements all domain-specific train queries.
- Supports:
  - Trains between stations
  - Train schedules
  - Running days
  - Train routes and stops
- Ensures responses are strictly data-driven to prevent hallucinations.

**5. Train Repository**
- Converts raw schedule data into optimized in-memory structures.
- Maintains:
  - `trains`: Train metadata, routes, and operating details
  - `stations`: Station-centric mappings for efficient lookups
- Enables fast and reliable query execution.

**6. Schedule Loader**
- Loads train schedule data from the JSON dataset.
- Provides structured input to the repository layer.
- Serves as the single source of truth for data ingestion.
